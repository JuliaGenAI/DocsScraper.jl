DocsScraper is a package designed to create a vector database from input URLs. It scrapes and parses the URLs and with the help of PromptingTools.jl, creates a vector store that can be used in a RAG applications. It integrates with AIHelpMe.jl and PromptingTools.jl to offer highly efficient and relevant query retrieval, ensuring that the responses generated by the system are specific to the content in the created database.

## Features

- **URL Scraping and Parsing**: Automatically scrapes and parses input URLs to extract relevant information, paying particular attention to code snippets and code blocks. Gives an option to customize the chunk sizes
- **URL Crawling**: Optionally crawls the input URLs to look for multiple pages in the same domain.
- **Vector Database Creation**: Leverages PromptingTools.jl to create embeddings with customizable embedding model, size and type (Bool and Float32). 

## Installation

To install DocsScraper, use the Julia package manager and the package name:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("DocsScraper")
```


**Prerequisites:**

- Julia (version 1.10 or later).
- Internet connection for API access.
- OpenAI API keys with available credits. See [How to Obtain API Keys](#how-to-obtain-api-keys).


## Usage
```julia
index = make_knowledge_packs(; single_urls=["https://docs.sciml.ai/Overview/stable/"], index_name="sciml", embedding_size=1024)
```
```

`make_knowledge_packs` is the entry point to the package. This function takes in the URLs to parse and returns the index. This index can be passed to AIHelpMe.jl to answer queries on the built knowledge packs.

**Using the created index:**
```
using AIHelpMe
sciml_index = AIHelpMe.load_index!(index)
aihelp(sciml_index, "what is Sciml")
```
```

SciML, or Scientific Machine Learning, is an ecosystem developed in the Julia programming language, aimed at solving equations and modeling systems while integrating the capabilities of      
scientific computing and machine learning. It provides a range of tools with unified APIs, enabling features like differentiability, sensitivity analysis, high performance, and parallel      
implementations. The SciML organization supports these tools and promotes their coherent use for various scientific applications.
